The mobile app sends a request to the ride-sharing service's API, which then processes the request and returns the relevant information, such as driver details and estimated arrival time, back to the mobile app."

    "\n",
    "1. Modularity and Code Reusability: APIs allow developers to modularize their code by encapsulating functionality into reusable components. This promotes code reusability, reduces duplication, and enhances development efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Seamless Integration and Interoperability: APIs enable different software systems to seamlessly integrate and communicate with each other. They provide a standardized interface for exchanging data and functionality, facilitating interoperability between disparate systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of using APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dependency on External Services: When relying on external APIs, applications become dependent on the availability and reliability of those services. If the API provider experiences downtime or makes changes to their API, it can impact the functionality and performance of the dependent application.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Lack of Control and Flexibility: API functionality is typically defined and controlled by the provider. Developers using an API may be limited by the features, rate limits, and data formats supported by the API. This lack of control and flexibility can sometimes restrict the customization and optimization possibilities for the consuming application."

While API is a general term for any interface that enables interaction between software components, a Web API specifically refers to APIs that are designed for web-based applications and use web protocols like HTTP. Web APIs are often used to enable communication between client-side applications (e.g., web browsers, mobile apps) and server-side applications (e.g., web servers, cloud services) over the internet."

    "1. Complexity: SOAP involves complex XML-based message formats and requires detailed WSDL definitions, making it more challenging to implement and maintain compared to REST.\n",

    "2. Overhead: SOAP messages tend to be larger in size due to XML structure and can result in more network overhead. This can impact performance, especially in bandwidth-constrained scenarios.\n",
