The researcher wants to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean test scores between the two groups. In this case, a t-test would be appropriate because the population variance is unknown, and the sample size is relatively small (n = 20).\n",

In this case, a z-test would be appropriate because the population variance is known, and the sample size is likely to be large.
